# Advance House Price Prediction using Sagemaker

The House Price Predictor is an advanced machine learning application designed to predict house prices based on various features. Utilizing Amazon SageMaker, this project employs powerful algorithms to analyze historical real estate data and provide accurate predictions for property values. The application is user-friendly, making it an invaluable tool for homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals seeking data-driven insights. It employs advanced machine learning algorithms, coupled with AWS GuardRail, and Shadow Testing methodologies, for better scalability and consistency of the deployed application. AWS Jumpstart is also used to train the model using Low Code approach.

## Key Components:
1. Amazon SageMaker Integration: 
Seamlessly integrates with Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed machine learning service, to streamline model training, deployment, and scaling.

2. AWS Jumpstart for Efficient Model Training:
Expedites model training through AWS Jumpstart, leveraging pre-configured machine learning environments for rapid development and deployment.

3. GuardRail for Model Governance:
Enforces model governance and compliance through GuardRail, ensuring adherence to ethical and regulatory standards.

4. Shadow Testing for Deployment Confidence:
Implements Shadow Testing during deployment to run the model alongside the existing system, providing confidence in performance before full-scale deployment.
